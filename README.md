## Understanding the Output

### Token Types
- **Input Tokens**: Tokens sent to Claude
- **Output Tokens**: Tokens generated by Claude
- **Cache Read**: Tokens read from cache (90% cheaper)
- **Cache Write**: Tokens written to cache

### Cost Analysis
The tool shows:
- Actual token costs at pay-as-you-go rates
- Savings when using Claude Max plans
- Cache efficiency percentage
- Projected monthly costs

### 5-Hour Blocks
Claude uses 5-hour windows for rate limiting. The blocks view helps you:
- Track usage within rate limit windows
- See burn rate per hour
- Project total block cost
- Monitor active blocks in real-time

## Requirements

- Node.js 16+
- Claude Code must be installed and used at least once
- Access to `~/.claude/projects/` directory

## How It Works

ccusage reads Claude's log files from `~/.claude/projects/*/claude.jsonl` and calculates costs based on current model pricing. It tracks:

1. Token usage per request
2. Model used for each request
3. Cache efficiency
4. Timestamps for aggregation

## Privacy

All data is read locally from your machine. No data is sent to external servers.

## Inspired By

This tool is inspired by the original ccusage tool mentioned in "The COST of Claude Code" YouTube video. It provides similar functionality for tracking Claude Code usage and costs.
